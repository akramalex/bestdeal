### Structure
To help visualize a typical user journey around the site, I used [lucid.app](https://lucid.app/) to plan out the various routes. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of the free version of the tool, I am unable to provide a more detailed picture of the user journey. However, the flow provides a clear representation of how users would typically navigate through the platform.
