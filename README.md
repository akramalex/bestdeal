#### Scope 

Given the time and resource constraints, we will prioritize core features for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product). These features are categorized as Must-Have, Should-Have, and Won’t-Have for the initial release, and can be expanded in future phases.

#### UX Efforts Must Address These:

 1- User Login & Authentication

 * Users must be able to easily create an account and log in to the platform. The login and registration process should be smooth and secure, with options for password recovery.

 2- Product Browsing & Searching

 * Implement a seamless product browsing experience. Ensure that the search bar is prominent, and users can filter and sort products by categories, price,  rating, . This will help users find products quickly and efficiently.

3- Product Page Design

 * Each product page should clearly display product details, such as name, description, price, reviews. High-quality images, videos, and size/color options should also be available in a user-friendly layout.

4- Seamless Shopping Cart Experience

 * Users should easily add items to their shopping cart and view the total cost, with options to update quantities, remove items.


 5- Simplified Checkout Process

 * The checkout process should be simple and secure, offering  payment option (Stripe). Allow users to review their order before confirming the purchase.

 -6 Responsive Design for All Devices
 * Ensure that the website is fully responsive and works seamlessly across mobile phones, tablets, and desktops. This is crucial for maintaining a consistent experience for all users, regardless of their device.   


 7- Order Confirmation
 * After a purchase is made, users should receive an email confirmation.

 8 - User Reviews & Ratings 

 * Implement a product review system that allows customers to rate products and share feedback. This feature will help potential buyers make informed decisions and increase user engagement.


 9 - Wishlist Feature

 * Provide users with the ability to add products to a wishlist. This helps users save products for future purchases and enhances their shopping experience by reminding them of items they’re interested in.

 10 - Customer Support Access

 * Make customer support easily accessible through chat, email, or phone. Provide FAQs or a help center to assist with common queries. Fast response times are essential to maintaining customer satisfaction.

 11 - Simple and Intuitive Navigation

 * The navigation menu should be easy to understand and navigate. Categories and subcategories should be clearly defined, and users should be able to access all relevant pages, such as product listings, shopping cart, and user profile, with minimal effort.

 12-  Security and Privacy
 
 * Customers should feel confident when making transactions on the site. Use secure payment gateways and ensure that customer data is protected with SSL encryption. Also, display privacy policies clearly.

 13 - Product Recommendations

 * Use data-driven algorithms to recommend products based on users' browsing history, past purchases, or popular items. These personalized suggestions can help increase sales and improve the overall user experience.

14 - SEO Optimization 

* Optimize the website for search engines to ensure that products are easily discoverable by users. Use proper metadata, image alt text, and structured data to improve the site's ranking in search results.


#### UX Efforts Should Accommodate These:

1- Product Excerpts on Homepage 
* Display product previews, such as product names, prices, and images, on the homepage to give users an easy glimpse of what's available. Clicking on a preview should lead to the product detail page.

2- Contact Form 
* Include a simple, easy-to-use contact form that allows users to reach out to administrators with inquiries, suggestions, or support requests. Ensure the form is visible and accessible, and provide a thank-you message after submission.

3- Guest Checkout Option

* Offer a guest checkout option for users who prefer not to create an account. However, encourage users to sign up for an account by offering benefits such as order tracking, wishlists, and faster future checkouts.

4- Order History for Customers

* Enable customers to easily view and track their order history, including past purchases and the status of current orders. Users should also be able to reorder items they previously bought.

5- Advanced Filtering Options 

* Allow users to filter products by a variety of parameters (e.g., price range, color, size, rating, and more). This will make it easier for users to find exactly what they are looking for.

#### Unwise Use of Time to Address There:

1 - Promotions and Discounts Section
* Create a dedicated section for promotions, deals, or discounts, easily accessible from the homepage. This section should be highlighted to encourage users to take advantage of special offers.  will be in time wise 

2- FAQ Section 

* Add a frequently asked questions (FAQ) section to help users find answers to common queries about products, returns, shipping, payment methods, etc.

3- Stock Availability Alerts

* Notify users if a product they are interested in is out of stock and offer the option to be alerted when it becomes available again. This feature can help increase sales when products are restocked.

4 -Product Comparison Tool

5- Basic Admin Analytics
* Track basic metrics for the admin, such as the number of items added to the cart, purchases made, and product popularity. This data will help the admin understand the market and optimize the product offerings.

### Structure
To help visualize a typical user journey around the site, I used [lucid.app](https://lucid.app/) to plan out the various routes. Unfortunately, due to the limitations of the free version of the tool, I am unable to provide a more detailed picture of the user journey. However, the flow provides a clear representation of how users would typically navigate through the platform.

   ###### Acceptance Criteria

###  Skeleton

  #### Wireframes:
  The appearance of each page of the website was planned by making wireframes. It was essential to provide a positive user experience for the user.

Initially, wireframes plans were hand-drawn on a notepad. More detailed wireframes were then created using a desktop version of [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.cloud/). 
They can be found below:

 - home page

![](static/images/wireframe1.jpg)

- Products page

![](static/images/wireframe2.jpg)

- Product details page


![](static/images/product1.jpg)

- contact us  page


![](static/images/contactw.jpg)


- small screen

![](static/images/phone-home.jpg)

![](static/images/phone-footer.jpg)


###  Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) help to visualize database architecture before creating models. Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project. To follow best practices, a database schema was created for the backend DB and tables, and mapped out before coding began using a free version of [Lucidchart](https://lucid.app/).


Below is the database structure:

![](static/images/derd.jpeg)


#### Surface

#### Color Scheme: 


I used the following image to generate the color scheme on [coolers](https://coolors.co/). The resultant color scheme is:
