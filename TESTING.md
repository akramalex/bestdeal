# Testing

Return back to the [README.md](https://github.com/akramalex/bestdeal/blob/main/README.md) file.

* I tested that this page works in different browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer.

* I confirmed that this project is responsive, looks good, and functions on all standard screen sizes using devtools and the device toolbar.

* I confirmed that the navigation header, "all product," "my account", "profile", "bag", "product management", "register /sign in / log out" and "Contact" text are all readable and easy to understand.

* I have confirmed that the form works, requires entries in every field, and will only accept an email in the email field.
